   		 <p> In this game, players will be able to make their desired Acai bowl by choosing certain fruits, toppings, and sauces to go on top. The turtle will then work to deliver your dream bowl onto your screen! There are a total of 4 fruits, 3 toppings, and 2 sauces, so there are countless possibilities. </p>

	 	 <img src = "Screenshot 2025-03-17 110235.png" height="350">
	   	 <p> This is a fruit-catching game in which you are supposed to catch the apples and avoid the poisonous fruit, in a Minecraft theme. This game features a leaderboard with the top 3 scores, the score, the 3 lives that you have each attempt, and progressive difficulty that makes the game hard as your score goes up. The player uses arrow keys to control the basket on the bottom and catch as many fruit as possible! </p>
